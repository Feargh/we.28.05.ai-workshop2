# Kanban Board: Functional Specification

## Overview

A collaborative Kanban board application built as a local web app where users can manage tasks by adding, updating, and moving them between columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done".

## Core Features

### 1. Board Layout

- Three fixed columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done"
- Clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Visual distinction between columns

### 2. Task Management

#### Task Properties
- Title (required)
- Description (optional)
- Status (To Do, Doing, Done)
- Priority (Low, Medium, High)
- Due Date (optional)

#### Task Operations
- Create new tasks via a form
- View task details
- Edit existing tasks
- Move tasks between columns (change status)
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by priority and due date

### 3. Data Persistence

- Store tasks in a JSON file
- Read/write operations through Next.js API routes
- Automatic update of UI when data changes

### 4. User Interface

- Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet
- Intuitive task creation form
- Clear visual indicators for task priority
- Due date display on task cards

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance
- Fast initial load time (< 3 seconds)
- Responsive UI interaction

### Usability
- Intuitive drag-and-drop or click-based movement of tasks
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Simple, clean interface

### Constraints
- No authentication required
- No multi-user collaborative features
- Local deployment only

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the current implementation:

- User authentication and accounts
- Real-time collaboration
- Cloud deployment
- Customizable columns
- Task attachments
- Activity history
