# Development History - Alex

## Completed Tickets

### BE-01: Project Setup and Initial Configuration
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS
- Established directory structure as specified in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Added base configuration files

### BE-02: Define TypeScript Data Models
- Created `src/types/index.ts` with Task interface and supporting types
- Implemented TaskStatus and TaskPriority as type aliases for better reusability
- Added utility types for API operations:
  - TaskCreationPayload: For creating new tasks (omits auto-generated fields)
  - TaskUpdatePayload: For updating tasks (makes fields optional except id)

### BE-03: Implement File-based Data Storage
- Created `src/utils/fileStorage.ts` with functions for file operations:
  - Core functions: readTasks(), writeTasks()
  - Higher-level operations: addTask(), updateTask(), deleteTask()
- Implemented error handling with try/catch blocks
- Created initial `data/tasks.json` file structure with empty array

### BE-04: Create Task API Routes (GET and POST)
- Implemented Next.js API route in `pages/api/tasks.ts` for:
  - GET: Retrieving all tasks from the JSON file
  - POST: Creating new tasks with validation
- Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implemented input validation for required fields
- Tested endpoints with sample task data
- Used UUID for generating unique task IDs

## Key Decisions and Patterns

- Using type aliases for enum-like values (TaskStatus, TaskPriority)
- Leveraging TypeScript utility types (Omit, Partial) for derived interfaces
- Thorough JSDoc comments for better code documentation
- Following naming conventions from CLAUDE.md:
  - PascalCase for interfaces (Task)
  - camelCase for type aliases and functions
- Using async/await for all file operations
- Implementing core read/write functions and higher-level utility functions for better API design
- Error handling pattern: try/catch with specific error messages
- Using switch statements for API route handling based on HTTP method
- Separating handler logic into method-specific functions for better readability

## Current State

Project has a working REST API for retrieving and creating tasks. The API uses file-based JSON storage for persistence. Ready to implement update and delete operations in BE-05.
