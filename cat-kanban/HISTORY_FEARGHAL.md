# Development History - Fearghal

## Completed Tickets

### FE-01: Create Base UI Components
- Created base components directory structure
- Implemented layout components:
  - `Layout.tsx`: Main layout with optional header and footer
  - `Header.tsx`: Application header with title
  - `Footer.tsx`: Simple footer component
- Implemented UI components:
  - `Button.tsx`: Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, success) and sizes
  - `Card.tsx`: Content container with optional header and footer
- Updated global styling using Tailwind:
  - Enhanced `globals.css` with proper Tailwind imports
  - Added CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode)
  - Created color schemes for Kanban columns and task priorities
  - Added component-specific utility classes
- Established component styling patterns:
  - Created components/README.md documenting styling conventions
  - Used consistent prop interfaces with TypeScript
  - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind's utility classes
- Updated root layout and page to use new components

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration for v4 compatibility:
  - Created tailwind.config.js file with proper content paths and theme extensions
  - Updated postcss.config.mjs to use the @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - Modified globals.css to use the v4 import style (@import 'tailwindcss')
  - Installed required autoprefixer package

## Key Decisions and Patterns

- Component organization:
  - Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Default prop values to simplify component usage
  - Components export pattern for easier imports
- Styling approach:
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
  - Tailwind utility classes for component styling
  - Component-specific classes defined in `@layer components`
  - Consistent spacing, typography, and color patterns
  - Tailwind v4 configuration with proper CSS imports
- Component architecture:
  - Composition pattern with children and optional slots (header, footer)
  - Consistent props pattern across components
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Current State

The project now has base UI components necessary for building the Kanban board interface. Global styling has been properly configured with Tailwind CSS v4, and component patterns have been established. The main page demonstrates these components with a simple welcome screen. Ready to proceed with implementing Board and Column components in FE-02.

## Configuration Details

### Tailwind Configuration
- Tailwind v4.1.7 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- PostCSS configuration using the new v4 plugin structure
- CSS variables for themeable color schemes
- Custom utility classes for Kanban-specific UI elements

## Notes for Future Development

- Continue to follow established component patterns for consistency
- Use the created Button and Card components as the foundation for task cards
- Leverage the Layout component for all pages
- Continue using the CSS variables for theming
- Maintain the Tailwind v4 configuration pattern when adding new styles
