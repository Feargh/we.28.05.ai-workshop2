# Development History - Fearghal

## Completed Tickets

### FE-01: Create Base UI Components
- Created base components directory structure
- Implemented layout components:
  - `Layout.tsx`: Main layout with optional header and footer
  - `Header.tsx`: Application header with title
  - `Footer.tsx`: Simple footer component
- Implemented UI components:
  - `Button.tsx`: Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, success) and sizes
  - `Card.tsx`: Content container with optional header and footer
- Updated global styling using Tailwind:
  - Enhanced `globals.css` with proper Tailwind imports
  - Added CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode)
  - Created color schemes for Kanban columns and task priorities
  - Added component-specific utility classes
- Established component styling patterns:
  - Created components/README.md documenting styling conventions
  - Used consistent prop interfaces with TypeScript
  - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind's utility classes
- Updated root layout and page to use new components

### FE-02: Implement Board and Column Components
- Created Kanban board structure with three columns:
  - `Board.tsx`: Main container component with responsive grid layout
  - `Column.tsx`: Individual column component with status-based styling
- Applied Tailwind utility classes for responsive design:
  - Mobile-first approach with stacked columns on small screens
  - Grid layout for larger screens showing all columns side-by-side
- Integrated with existing component patterns:
  - Used TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Applied the CSS variables for theming
  - Leveraged component-specific utility classes
- Updated main page to showcase the Kanban board

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration for v4 compatibility:
  - Created tailwind.config.js file with proper content paths and theme extensions
  - Updated postcss.config.mjs to use the @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - Modified globals.css to use the v4 import style (@import 'tailwindcss')
  - Installed required autoprefixer package

## Key Decisions and Patterns

- Component organization:
  - Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Default prop values to simplify component usage
  - Components export pattern for easier imports
- Styling approach:
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
  - Tailwind utility classes for component styling
  - Component-specific classes defined in `@layer components`
  - Consistent spacing, typography, and color patterns
  - Tailwind v4 configuration with proper CSS imports
- Component architecture:
  - Composition pattern with children and optional slots (header, footer)
  - Consistent props pattern across components
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Kanban board structure:
  - Three fixed columns (To Do, Doing, Done) as specified in requirements
  - Status-based styling using CSS variables for visual distinction
  - Column component with ability to render custom content for each status

## Current State

The project now has a functioning Kanban board structure with three visually distinct columns. The board is responsive and follows the established component patterns. It's ready for integration with the task data context and task card components in the next tickets.

## Configuration Details

### Tailwind Configuration
- Tailwind v4.1.7 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- PostCSS configuration using the new v4 plugin structure
- CSS variables for themeable color schemes
- Custom utility classes for Kanban-specific UI elements

## Notes for Future Development

- Upcoming task context implementation will populate the board with actual tasks
- Task card component will be built on top of the existing Card component
- Column component can be extended with drag-and-drop functionality later
- Maintain the established pattern of CSS variables for consistent theming
- Consider adding column-specific animations for task movements in future iterations
