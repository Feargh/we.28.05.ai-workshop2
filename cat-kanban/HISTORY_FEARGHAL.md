  - Implemented proper error handling for API calls
- Updated app layout to include TaskProvider:
  - Wrapped application in TaskProvider for global state access

  - Implemented `Task.tsx` with a clean, consistent UI
  - Integrated with the Card component for consistent styling
  - Added visual indicators for priority using color-coded badges
  - Implemented due date display and task metadata
- Added task movement functionality:
  - Included status-specific action buttons (Start, Complete, Back, Reopen)
  - Integrated with useTasks hook for status changes
- Updated main page to use the Task component:
  - Modified page.tsx to display tasks in their respective columns
  - Added empty state messaging for columns without tasks
  - Implemented loading and error states
- Ensured code quality:
  - Passed linting and type checking
  - Followed project coding standards and patterns
  - Used proper TypeScript interfaces for props

### FE-05: Create Task Creation Form
- Implemented form for creating new tasks:
  - Created `TaskForm.tsx` component with all required fields:
    - Title (required)
    - Description (optional)
    - Status selection
    - Priority selection
    - Due date (optional)
  - Added form validation:
    - Required field validation for title
    - Date format validation for due date
    - Clear error messaging for validation failures
  - Integrated with TaskContext for task creation:
    - Connected form submission to createTask method
    - Added loading state during form submission
    - Implemented error handling for failed submissions
  - Updated main page to include task creation functionality:
    - Added "Create Task" button to page header
    - Implemented toggle functionality to show/hide the form
    - Added form success and cancellation handlers
  - Implemented form styling:
    - Consistent with application design patterns
    - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
    - Clear visual hierarchy of form elements

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration for v4 compatibility:
  - Created tailwind.config.js file with proper content paths and theme extensions
  - Updated postcss.config.mjs to use the @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - Modified globals.css to use the v4 import style (@import 'tailwindcss')
  - Installed required autoprefixer package

## Key Decisions and Patterns

- Component organization:
  - Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Default prop values to simplify component usage
  - Components export pattern for easier imports
- Styling approach:
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
  - Tailwind utility classes for component styling
  - Component-specific classes defined in `@layer components`
  - Consistent spacing, typography, and color patterns
  - Tailwind v4 configuration with proper CSS imports
- Component architecture:
  - Composition pattern with children and optional slots (header, footer)
  - Consistent props pattern across components
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- State management:
  - React Context API for global task state
  - Custom hooks for component-specific functionality
  - Error handling and loading states for better UX
  - Clean separation of API calls and state management
- Kanban board structure:
  - Three fixed columns (To Do, Doing, Done) as specified in requirements
  - Status-based styling using CSS variables for visual distinction
  - Column component with ability to render custom content for each status
- Task component patterns:
  - Used Card component as a base for consistent styling
  - Implemented contextual action buttons based on task status
  - Visual priority indicators with appropriate color coding
  - Clean presentation of dates and metadata
- Form implementation patterns:
  - Reusable form component supporting both creation and editing
  - Form validation with immediate error feedback
  - Loading states during form submission
  - Consistent form layout and styling

## Current State

The project now has a functioning Kanban board with three visually distinct columns and task cards displaying all relevant information. The board is responsive and follows the established component patterns. Tasks can be viewed, moved between columns, and have visual indicators for their priority and due dates. Users can create new tasks using the form accessible from the main page. The task creation form includes validation and proper error handling. The application now needs task editing functionality to complete the core task management features.

## Issues and Workarounds

- TaskForm submission issue:
  - Form submission requires both onSubmit handler on form element and onClick handler on submit button
  - This redundancy ensures form validation and submission works across all browsers and user interaction patterns

## Configuration Details

### Tailwind Configuration
- Tailwind v4.1.7 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- PostCSS configuration using the new v4 plugin structure
- CSS variables for themeable color schemes
- Custom utility classes for Kanban-specific UI elements

### Next.js Configuration
- Using the App Router architecture
- Client components marked with "use client" directive
- API routes implemented in the Pages Router for compatibility

## Notes for Future Development

- Implement task editing functionality (FE-06)
- Implement task deletion with confirmation (FE-08)
- Implement task filtering by priority and due date (FE-09)
- Add error boundaries and loading indicators for better user experience (FE-10)
- Consider adding drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks in future iterations
