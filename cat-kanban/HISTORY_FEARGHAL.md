# Development History - Fearghal

## Completed Tickets

### FE-01: Create Base UI Components
- Created base components directory structure
- Implemented layout components:
  - `Layout.tsx`: Main layout with optional header and footer
  - `Header.tsx`: Application header with title
  - `Footer.tsx`: Simple footer component
- Implemented UI components:
  - `Button.tsx`: Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, success) and sizes
  - `Card.tsx`: Content container with optional header and footer
- Updated global styling using Tailwind:
  - Enhanced `globals.css` with proper Tailwind imports
  - Added CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode)
  - Created color schemes for Kanban columns and task priorities
  - Added component-specific utility classes
- Established component styling patterns:
  - Created components/README.md documenting styling conventions
  - Used consistent prop interfaces with TypeScript
  - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind's utility classes
- Updated root layout and page to use new components

### FE-02: Implement Board and Column Components
- Created Kanban board structure with three columns:
  - `Board.tsx`: Main container component with responsive grid layout
  - `Column.tsx`: Individual column component with status-based styling
- Applied Tailwind utility classes for responsive design:
  - Mobile-first approach with stacked columns on small screens
  - Grid layout for larger screens showing all columns side-by-side
- Integrated with existing component patterns:
  - Used TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Applied the CSS variables for theming
  - Leveraged component-specific utility classes
- Updated main page to showcase the Kanban board

### FE-03: Create Task Context and Hooks
- Implemented React Context for task state management:
  - Created `contexts/TaskContext.tsx` with full CRUD operations
  - Added loading and error states for better UX
  - Implemented helper methods for filtering tasks by status
- Created custom hooks for task operations:
  - Implemented `hooks/useTasks.ts` to simplify component integration
  - Added convenience methods like `moveTask` and `getTasksGroupedByStatus`
- Created API utility functions:
  - Added `utils/api.ts` with functions for all API endpoints
  - Implemented proper error handling for API calls
- Updated app layout to include TaskProvider:
  - Wrapped application in TaskProvider for global state access
  - Added "use client" directive for Next.js App Router compatibility

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration for v4 compatibility:
  - Created tailwind.config.js file with proper content paths and theme extensions
  - Updated postcss.config.mjs to use the @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - Modified globals.css to use the v4 import style (@import 'tailwindcss')
  - Installed required autoprefixer package

## Key Decisions and Patterns

- Component organization:
  - Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Default prop values to simplify component usage
  - Components export pattern for easier imports
- Styling approach:
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
  - Tailwind utility classes for component styling
  - Component-specific classes defined in `@layer components`
  - Consistent spacing, typography, and color patterns
  - Tailwind v4 configuration with proper CSS imports
- Component architecture:
  - Composition pattern with children and optional slots (header, footer)
  - Consistent props pattern across components
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- State management:
  - React Context API for global task state
  - Custom hooks for component-specific functionality
  - Error handling and loading states for better UX
  - Clean separation of API calls and state management
- Kanban board structure:
  - Three fixed columns (To Do, Doing, Done) as specified in requirements
  - Status-based styling using CSS variables for visual distinction
  - Column component with ability to render custom content for each status

## Current State

The project now has a functioning Kanban board structure with three visually distinct columns and a complete task state management system. The board is responsive and follows the established component patterns. Tasks can be created, updated, moved between columns, and deleted through the TaskContext API. The application is ready for implementing the task card components and form interfaces in the next tickets.

## Configuration Details

### Tailwind Configuration
- Tailwind v4.1.7 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- PostCSS configuration using the new v4 plugin structure
- CSS variables for themeable color schemes
- Custom utility classes for Kanban-specific UI elements

### Next.js Configuration
- Using the App Router architecture
- Client components marked with "use client" directive
- API routes implemented in the Pages Router for compatibility

## Notes for Future Development

- Implement Task card component to display task data in columns
- Create task creation and editing forms
- Add UI controls for moving tasks between columns
- Implement task filtering by priority and due date
- Add error boundaries and loading indicators for better user experience
- Consider adding drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks in future iterations
